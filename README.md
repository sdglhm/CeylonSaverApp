API providing images for CeylonSaver screensaver

### How to Add my image to the Project

1. Clone your repo
2. Add your image to `wallpapers` folder as a JPG
3. Make sure your image is sized more than 1024x768
4. Open a PR with your image

```diff
+ Format for naming your image - {lahiru-himesh-kandy.jpg}
+ Use - instead of spaces

- Do not put spaces in your file name, your PR will be rejected
- Do not overwrite another persons image, your PR will be rejected

@@ If there are any sensitive information in your image, your PR will be rejected @@
```

Note: *To Add your image to the Screensaver, format it to a 16:9 aspect ratio*

### Credits

At the moment, we don't have a way of providing credits for the images, but it will be implemented so there will be an overlay on your picture with your information.
